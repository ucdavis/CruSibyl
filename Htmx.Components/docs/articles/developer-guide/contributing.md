# Contributing to Htmx.Components

We welcome contributions to the Htmx.Components framework! This guide will help you get started with contributing code, documentation, and reporting issues.

**Important Note**: This library is developed primarily for our organization's internal use. While we welcome quality contributions, we cannot provide support for external users or guarantee compatibility with external use cases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio Code
- Basic understanding of ASP.NET Core, HTMX, and Entity Framework Core

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Open the solution in your preferred IDE
4. Build the solution to ensure everything compiles

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Contributions

We welcome the following types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes**: Clear, focused fixes for identified issues
- **Performance improvements**: Optimizations with measurable benefits
- **Documentation improvements**: Better examples, clearer explanations
- **Test coverage**: Additional unit tests or integration tests

### What We're NOT Looking For

- **New features without prior discussion**: Please open an issue first
- **Breaking changes**: We prioritize stability for our internal use
- **External dependencies**: We prefer to keep dependencies minimal
- **Style-only changes**: We have established coding standards

### Code Standards

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Include appropriate documentation for public APIs
- Add tests for new functionality when applicable
- Ensure all existing tests pass

### Submitting Changes

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes with clear, focused commits
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Submit a pull request with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Reference to any related issues
   - Explanation of testing performed

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues:

- Use the provided issue templates
- Include minimal reproduction steps
- Specify your environment (.NET version, OS, etc.)
- **Note**: We cannot guarantee timely responses to external issue reports

## Development Notes

### Architecture Principles

- **Convention over configuration**: Prefer attribute-based configuration
- **Minimal dependencies**: Keep external dependencies to a minimum
- **Performance-focused**: Optimize for our specific use cases
- **HTMX-first**: Design with HTMX patterns in mind

### Key Areas for Contribution

- **Table component optimizations**
- **Authorization pattern improvements**
- **Documentation and examples**
- **Test coverage expansion**

## Review Process

All contributions go through our internal review process:

1. Automated build and test verification
2. Code review by core team members
3. Integration testing with our applications
4. Final approval and merge

**Timeline**: Reviews are conducted on our internal schedule. External contributions may take longer to review as they are not our primary focus.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as the project.

## Questions?

While we cannot provide dedicated support for external contributors, you can:
- Review existing documentation and code examples
- Search through existing issues for similar problems
- Submit clear, well-documented issues for consideration

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Htmx.Components!
