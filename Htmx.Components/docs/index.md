# HTMX Components

A powerful .NET library that provides server-side components for building dynamic web applications with HTMX. This library simplifies the creation of interactive UIs with table management, navigation, authentication status, and form handling - all with minimal JavaScript.

## Key Features

- **Table Components**: Full-featured data tables with sorting, filtering, pagination, and inline editing
- **Navigation System**: Attribute-based or programmatic navigation with authorization integration
- **Authentication Integration**: Built-in authentication status components and OIDC support
- **Form Handling**: Seamless form processing with page state management
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained permission system with resource-operation based access control
- **Out-of-Band Updates**: Efficient partial page updates using HTMX's OOB functionality
- **JavaScript Behaviors**: Server-generated JavaScript behaviors for enhanced interactivity

## Quick Start

```csharp
// Program.cs
builder.Services.AddHtmxComponents(options =>
{
    options.WithAuthorizationRequirementFactory<MyPermissionFactory>();
    options.WithResourceOperationRegistry<MyResourceRegistry>();
});

builder.Services.AddMvc()
    .AddHtmxComponentsApplicationPart();

// Configure the pipeline
app.UseHtmxPageState();
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
```
